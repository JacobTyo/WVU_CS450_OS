SYNOPSIS

	pcb [arguments]
	pcb --create [pcb name] [class] [priority]
	    class: 0 = system
	    class: 1 = application
	    priority: 0(high)-9(low)

	    creates a new pcb with the name meowmeow with a class 0(system) with a priority of 1.
	    
	pcb --delete meowmeow
	    deletes the pcb named meowmeow. Returns an error if the pcb does not exist

	pcb --block meowmeow
	    removes the pcb named meowmeow from the ready queue, changes said pcb's running state to blocked, and reinserts the pcb into the blocked queue. Returns an error if pcb does not exist or if pcb is already in blocked state.

	pcb --unblock meowmeow
	    removes the pcb named meowmeow from the ready queue, changes said pcb's running state to ready, and reinserts the pcb into the ready queue. Returns an error if the pcb does not exist or if pcb is already in the ready state.
